# Simple Game using OpenGL (C++)

## Overview
This project is a simple game created using OpenGL. It was developed as the final project for my bachelor's degree in 2015. The game is inspired by the classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries of the game area.

## Features
- **OpenGL Graphics:** Utilizes OpenGL for rendering graphics and creating an interactive gaming experience.
- **Classic Gameplay:** Offers a familiar gameplay experience inspired by the Snake game.
- **Simple Controls:** Players can control the movement of the snake using arrow keys or other specified controls.

## Requirements
- OpenGL library
- C/C++ compiler

## Controls
- Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake:
    - Up: Move the snake upward
    - Down: Move the snake downward
    - Left: Move the snake to the left
    - Right: Move the snake to the right
